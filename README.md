Hello! This crate name is reserved for an upcoming library

*Last update: March 5th, 2022*

## Planned Features

* **Tournament match generation**

Being able to generate round-robin matches randomly, from seeds, with full flexibility on restrictions.

For example: "I want most of the matches to be randomly generated, but I still want team A to play
against team B on the last round" can be doable by setting the match manually, then filling the rest
of the matches automatically with the generator (random or seeded).

* **Tournament bracket generation**

Being able to generate bracket matches, also randomly or from seeds, with the same flexibility stated
above.

Will include multiple types, such as single elimination or double elimination (winners+losers brackets),
multi-level, and more!

* **Multi-phase tournaments**

Some tournaments have different phases, such as a group phase, where half of the teams qualify for the
following, elimination phase. This crate is planned to have a lot of flexibility to create tournaments
with multiple phases.

* **...and more!**

I want this crate to have lots of tournament features, including but not exclusively, more-than-2-team
matches, an API for setting metadata for matches (like date and location), and stuff I can't even
mention right now.

I plan to also study more about tournaments, to learn core features and how versatile they can be
organized, so the library comes out neat!
